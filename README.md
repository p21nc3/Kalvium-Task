Task Screening: Backend + Frontend = Full Stack

## Fullstack Hiring has two questions

* The Backend Task.
  - Build a server server that responds to mathematical operations sent via URL. it also
maintains a history of the last 20 operations performed on the server.

* The Frontend Task.
  - Imagine you're building an attendance system for a class. The entire students in a class will
goto this UX, and mark their attendance.
Can you imagine the UI/UX for this, write a react project with the components and showcase
it.

I have attended both the questions from the above. My proficiency is in developing backend systems and recently I have started React for frontend.
